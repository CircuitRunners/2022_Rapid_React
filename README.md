#### YOU: Why create a new branch?

I'd like a simple way to show my code for everyone to view, by code I mean ~30 lines I've added in half an hour as a proof of concept.

Check out the [ws](./ws) directory or [Robot.java](./src/main/java/frc/robot/Robot.java) for slightly more details.

##### YOU: I don't like that you made a new branch!!!!!

cry about it (just delete it)

##### TLDR:

I added a TCP Server to the robot code and an example TCP client in Javascript. That way we can write our own fancy displays.
